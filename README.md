# battlecode2015

Get Started!
============

To set up, move this base directory into your `Battlecode2015` installation and rename it to `teams`.

We can use basic [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) to manage our submissions, which I'm also tagging as I go (so far) and storing in the `/submissions` folder.

Yay!

Strategy Brainstorming
======================

* Implement some high-level actions to use with deep/reinforcement learning
* Build a deep/reinforcement learning network to figure out the best strategies using those actions
